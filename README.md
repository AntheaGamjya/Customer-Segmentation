Unsupervised machine learning project
to segment customers on thier credit behaviour
we want to create multiple segments and we dont know based on which characteristic we are going to do it is the reason we are doing it on each characteristics
we will be creating segments 
(i was planning to deploy the model but it couldnt happen, I wanted to create a streamlit application based on clustering technique , where we take the customer details and identify which cluster belongs to which customer, but unfortunately it couldnt happen)
